# DDD, CQRS and ES
#### Three acronyms I've heard very smart people say very often
---

# Why are we here?

#### We're here to learn a little bit about three important concepts driving modern distributed systems architectures.

 ### - Domain Driven Design
 ### - Command-Query Responsibility Segregation
 ### - Event Sourcing

---

# DDD
**Domain Driven Design** is a method of designing systems of any kind. It's a philosophy,
it's not a tool, and it's not an implementation. Think "Agile", not "Scrum".

DDD was most popularly described in the "big blue book" by Eric Evans in 2003.

According to Eric, DDD has three main principles:
- Place the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic

- Base complex designs on a real-world model

- Initiate a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively cut ever closer to the conceptual heart of the problem.

# DDD

So, what is a **domain**?

A **domain** is a sphere of knowledge, influence, or activity. The subject area
to wihch the user applies a program is the domain of the software.

---

# DDD

Other important definitions:

**model**
A	 system	 of	 abstractions	 that	 describes	 selected	 aspects	 of	 a	 domain	 and	 can	 be	 used	 to
solve	problems	related	to	that	domain.

**ubiquitous	language**
A	 language	 structured	 around	 the	 domain	 model	 and	 used	 by	 all	 team	 members	 within	 a
bounded	context	to	connect	all	the	activities	of	the	team	with	the	software.

**context**
The	setting	in	which	a	word	or	statement	appears	 that	determines	its	meaning.	Statements
about	a	model	can	only	be	understood	in	a	context.

**bounded	context**
A	description	of	a	boundary	 (typically	a	subsystem,	or	the	work	of	a	particular	team)	within
which	a	particular	model	is	defined	and	applicable

## DDD Example - AppliTrack

The **domain** is the recruiting, hiring and onboarding of K-12 school district personnel.

[Examples of the **model**]

**ubiquitous language** - Applicant, Application, Reference, Certificate, Posting, Survey, Pre-screener, Job
 - Note that these do NOT include any AppliTrack specific terms! No mention of Requisitions, Workflows, Pipelines, etc.
 That's because ___the domain is what happens in the real world, and does not directly describe functions of the software___.

**bounded contexts** - Workflows, Report Generation, Forms, Interview Management

## However...

---

# DDD

&nbsp;
## AppliTrack was not created with domain driven design. :(

---

# DDD

Why are we talking about this? Why do we care?

---

# DDD

When a domain is expressed through software, DDD helps tell us what to build. It
describes the entities (objects), the services (business logic), and events (real-world events)
that the software needs to use.

Getting this right is _especially important_ in distributed, event-centric systems, because
changing them requires significantly more effort and coordination than traditional MVC architectures.

### tl;dr: DDD helps us build stuff right the first time

---
# Let's pause for a second...

So, we're not going to get into too much detail on DDD or any of these concepts. There are books,
talks, presentations, conferences, and thousands of blog articles to help.

What we are going to do is talk about what these concepts are, and why they are important.

Then we're going to keep talking about them.

#### We're not just learning new way of building software, but a new way of thinking.
